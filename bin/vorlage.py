"""1. General Description of the Gear
	•	Shape/Form: A round gear with evenly spaced teeth around the outer edge. In the center, there is a larger bore and four smaller bores arranged in a circular pattern around the center.
	•	Color/Material: Metallic appearance (silvery-gray), with no visible discoloration or signs of oxidation.
	•	Surface Structure: The surface appears smooth and reflects light evenly; there are no visible scratches or dents.
	•	Condition of the Teeth: The gear teeth are uniformly shaped with no signs of chipping or unusual indentations.

2. Categorization with Respect to Possible Defects
	1.	Tooth Clipping
	•	Observation: No broken or chipped gear teeth; all teeth are fully intact.
	•	Assessment: No evidence of clipping.
	2.	Surface Scratches
	•	Observation: The surface appears smooth with no visible lines, grooves, or scratches.
	•	Assessment: No surface scratches detected.
	3.	Wear Out
	•	Observation: The teeth appear uniform; no signs of excessive wear or erosion.
	•	Assessment: No wear observed.
	4.	Rust
	•	Observation: No rust or oxidation visible on the gears surface or in the bores.
	•	Assessment: Rust-free.
	5.	Production Errors
	•	Observation: The holes appear clean and symmetrical, and the overall shape seems precisely fabricated with no visible casting flaws or inaccuracies.
	•	Assessment: No production errors detected.
	6.	Dirt
	•	Observation: No dirt particles, residues, or other contaminants visible.
	•	Assessment: Clean and free of foreign matter.
